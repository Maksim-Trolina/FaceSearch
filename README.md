- reduces video resolution by 2 times
- 
- convert video to black and white format
- 
- displays the frame number in the corner of the video

Then save the new converted video as .mp4 format.

To work with the program, you need to install python3 and the opencv library.

opencv installation:
- Open a command prompt in the PythonVideo project folder

- Type in terminal "pip install opencv-python"

After installing everything you need, the program can be run through the command line.

Type "python main.py --image "path to video file"" at the command line.

After successful completion of the program, the output.mp4 file will appear. This file will be the result of video processing.
